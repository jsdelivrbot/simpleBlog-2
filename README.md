# My React Blog

## Reactjs, Axios, Redux, Heroku and hard work

This was a fun project to build learning to use react router to migrate pages without effecting the main body of the DOM was so cool the first time I wrote the code for it myself. Pairing redux and axios and diving into redux-promise to understand the way asynchronous calls work and why the promise system is the way it is in Javascript definitely became a lot easier after putting this mini blog together.
